# HealthCare Domain Project

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting health conditions using machine learning models. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, feature engineering, and various classification models are evaluated for accuracy.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is `kidney_disease.csv`.
- It contains patient health records with various features like blood pressure, sugar levels, and medical history.

## Preprocessing Steps
### 1. Handling Missing Values
- Missing values are treated using imputation techniques.
- Categorical missing values are replaced with mode.
- Numerical missing values are replaced with median.

### 2. Encoding Categorical Variables
- Categorical features with less than three unique values are one-hot encoded.
- Other categorical variables are label-encoded.

### 3. Outlier Detection
- Box plots are used to visualize outliers.
- No outlier treatment was required as per the analysis.

### 4. Feature Scaling
- Normalization using `MinMaxScaler` is applied where needed.

### 5. Handling Class Imbalance
- Since the problem involves classification, techniques such as oversampling and SMOTE can be used if needed.

## Model Building
### Machine Learning Models Implemented:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Voting Classifier (Combination of multiple models)**

## Model Evaluation
- Models are evaluated using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - Cross-validation
- Voting Classifier is used to improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple models.

## Visualization
- Seaborn box plots are used to detect outliers:
  ```python
  sns.boxplot(df_imp2[col])
  plt.show()
  ```
- Accuracy comparison of models using a bar plot:
  ```python
  sns.barplot(x="Method Used", y="Accuracy", data=df_accuracy)
  ```

## Results and Findings
- Training and test accuracy are compared to identify overfitting/underfitting issues.
- Cross-validation ensures model reliability.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Explore deep learning models for higher accuracy.
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib
   ```
2. Load the dataset and run the preprocessing steps.
3. Train and evaluate the machine learning models.
4. Compare accuracy and analyze model performance.

## Conclusion
This project applies various machine learning techniques to predict health conditions efficiently. The combination of preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation ensures accurate predictions.
